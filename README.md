# Polish Sign Language Recognition using Leap Motion Controller

The number of people who do not know sign language in our society is high. This situation reduces the communication between the hearing-impaired people and the society and even causes the hearing-impaired people to be isolated from the society. With this study, it is aimed to training people who wants to learn Sign Language to provide communication between people who know sign language and people who do not know sign language and to bring these disabled people to the society. Random Forest Classification applied to classify the 21 letters of the Polish Sign Language using the derived features from the Leap Motion Controller data. The experiment result shows that the highest average classification score 0.982 was achieved by Random Forest respectively. The result is a Polish Sign Language Recognition using Leap Motion capable of recognizing fixed signs with good but limited proficiency. While currently unable to recognize the full scope of signs due to Leap API and implementation shortcomings, a continuous effort to improve learning aids has the potential to significantly improve Sign Language education.
